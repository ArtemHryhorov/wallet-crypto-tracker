## ⚖️ Testing

Tests for `BalanceViewModel` include:
- Initial state and flow emissions
- Top-up dialog visibility
- Input validation
- Error message handling

## 🚫 Limitations & Improvements

- I want to separate i by features (balance/transaction), but they are coupled and related to one big feteature, so there is no sense in this separation
- Tests covered only on VM. Even inside this VM coverege could be beter. The issue is the lack of time
